# memorable-password-generator
My attempt at re creating Apple's "generate memorable password" from the Keychain app.
This is a personal project I developed for fun, and you're welcome to use the code as you see fit under the MIT license. I received a lot of valuable external help during its creation, so feel free to make the most of it!

## Running the project
```./setup_and_run.sh```

## Stop the app
```^C```
